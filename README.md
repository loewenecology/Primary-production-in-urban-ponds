Code and data for characterizing phytoplankton and periphyton communities in ponds based on diagnostic pigments and evaluating the effects of water quality factors on different taxonomic groups.

Pond_pigments_2022_ms.csv contains sample pigment data with rows corresponding to unique entries and columns corresponding to Site (sampling location name), Type (phytoplankton "Top" and periphyton "Slides"), and various pigments (Fucoxanthin, Neoxanthin, Violaxanthin, Diadinoxanthin, Myxoxanthophyll, Alloxanthin, Diatoxanthin, Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Lutein.Zeaxanthin, Canthaxanthin, Chlorophyll.b, Chlorophyll.a, and Pheophytin.a; with units in µg/L for "Top" samples and µg/cm2/d for "Slides" samples).

Pond_metals_2022_ms.csv contains metals concentrations from surface water quality samples with rows corresponding to unique entries and columns corresponding to Site (sampling location name), Total Cobalt (µg/L), Total Selenium (µg/L), Total Antimony (µg/L), Total Arsenic (µg/L), Total Nickel (µg/L), Total Rubidium (µg/L), Total Zinc (µg/L), Total Copper (µg/L), Total Aluminum (µg/L), Total Barium (µg/L), Total Manganese (µg/L), Total Iron (µg/L), Total Strontium (µg/L), Total Potassium (µg/L), Total Magnesium (µg/L), Total Sulphur (µg/L), Total Calcium (µg/L), Total Cadmium (µg/L), Total Lead (µg/L), Total Mercury (µg/L), Total Silver (µg/L), Total Thallium (µg/L), Total Beryllium (µg/L), Total Bismuth (µg/L), Total Cerium (µg/L), Total Cesium (µg/L), Total Chromium (µg/L), Total Europium (µg/L), Total Gallium (µg/L), Total Lanthanum (µg/L), Total Molybdenum (µg/L), Total Niobium (µg/L), Total Scandium (µg/L), Total Tellurium (µg/L), Total Thorium (µg/L), Total Tin (µg/L), Total Titanium (µg/L), Total Tungsten (µg/L), Total Uranium (µg/L), Total Vanadium (µg/L), Total Yttrium (µg/L), Total Zirconium (µg/L), Total Boron (µg/L), Total Lithium (µg/L), and Total Silicon (µg/L).

Pond_sites_2022_ms.csv contains site data with rows corresponding to sampling locations with columns corresponding to Site (sampling location name), Latitude (sampling location latitude), Longitude (sampling location longitude), Total Phosphorus (as P) (total phosphorus concentration; mg/L), NO3+NO2 (as N) (nitrate + nitrate concentration; mg/L), Total Suspended Solids (total suspended solids concentrations; mg/L), Field pH (field-measured pH; pH units), Field Temp (field-measured surface temperature; °C), and Chloride (dissolved chloride concentration; mg/L).
