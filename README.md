# Primary-production-in-urban-ponds
Code and data for characterizing phytoplankton and periphyton communities in ponds based on diagnostic pigments and evaluating the effects of water quality factors on different taxonomic groups.

Pond_pigments_2022_ms.csv contains sample pigment data with rows corresponding to unique entries and columns corresponding to Site (sampling location name), Type (phytoplankton "Top" and periphyton "Slides"), and various pigments (Fucoxanthin, Neoxanthin, Violaxanthin, Diadinoxanthin, Myxoxanthophyll, Alloxanthin, Diatoxanthin, Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Lutein.Zeaxanthin, Canthaxanthin, Chlorophyll.b, Chlorophyll.a, and Pheophytin.a; with units in µg/L for "Top" samples and µg/cm2/d for "Slides" samples).

Pond_sites_2022_ms.csv contains site data with rows corresponding to sampling locations with columns corresponding to Site (sampling location name), Latitude (sampling location latitude), Longitude (sampling location longitude), Total Phosphorus (as P) (total phosphorus concentration; mg/L), NO3+NO2 (as N) (nitrate + nitrate concentration; mg/L), Total Suspended Solids (total suspended solids concentrations; mg/L), Field pH (field-measured pH; pH units), Field Temp (field-measured surface temperature; °C), Chloride (dissolved chloride concentration; mg/L), Total Copper (total copper concentration; µg/L), Total Sodium (total sodium concentration; µg/L), and Conductance (specific conductance µS/cm).
